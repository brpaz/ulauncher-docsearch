## Motivation

Searching documentation is a constant need but not an easy task. Switch contexts between your code editor to the browser, remember the documentation site url and then find what you need. Many times, I kwew exactly what I want to find and that I have seen before, but simple cant find it again.

This extension, aims to make documentation search less painfull, allowing you to a full text search on popular documentation sites directly from directly from ulauncher.

## Requirements

- Ulauncher V5
- Python packages:
  - ```pip install --user "algoliasearch>=2.0,<3.0"```

## Install

Open ulauncher preferences window -> extensions -> add extension and paste the following url:

```
https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-docsearch
```


## Usage

![demo](demo.gif)


Open Ulauncher and type ```docs```. A list of available documentation sites will appear. Select one and type your search keyword to search on that website.

Optionally some documentation also supports a custom keyword, to trigger it directly without having to type ```docs``` before.

For example, for Vue documentation, you can just type ```vuedocs <query>```.

You can see the supported keywords in [manifest.json](manifest.json) file.


## Development

```
git clone https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-docsearch
make link
```

The `make link` command will symlink the cloned repo into the appropriate location on the ulauncher extensions folder.

To see your changes, stop ulauncher and run it from the command line with: `ulauncher -v`.
